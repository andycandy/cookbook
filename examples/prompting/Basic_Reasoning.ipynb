This means P(Weighted) = 1/5 = 0.2\n    *   4 in 5 dice are fair. This means P(Fair) = 4/5 = 0.8\n    *   A weighted die *always* rolls a 6. This means P(6 | Weighted) = 1\n    *   A fair die rolls a 6 with probability 1/6. This means P(6 | Fair) = 1/6\n\n2.  **Identify the problem.**\n\n    We want to find out whether it's more likely that the die was weighted, given that a 6 was rolled. In other words, we want to find P(Weighted | 6). We can use Bayes' Theorem to solve this.\n\n3.  **Provide a clear, step-by-step solution.**\n\n    Bayes' Theorem states:\n\n    P(A | B) = \\[P(B | A) \\* P(A)] / P(B)\n\n    In our case, A = Weighted and B = 6. So we want to find P(Weighted | 6).\n\n    *   P(Weighted | 6) = \\[P(6 | Weighted) \\* P(Weighted)] / P(6)\n\n    We know P(6 | Weighted) = 1 and P(Weighted) = 1/5 = 0.2.  We need to find P(6).\n\n    P(6) can be found using the law of total probability:\n\n    P(6) = P(6 | Weighted) \\* P(Weighted) + P(6 | Fair) \\* P(Fair)\n\n    P(6) = (1) \\* (1/5) + (1/6) \\* (4/5)\n    P(6) = 1/5 + 4/30\n    P(6) = 1/5 + 2/15\n    P(6) = 3/15 + 2/15\n    P(6) = 5/15 = 1/3\n\n    Now we can plug this back into Bayes' Theorem:\n\n    P(Weighted | 6) = \\[(1) \\* (1/5)] / (1/3)\n    P(Weighted | 6) = (1/5) / (1/3)\n    P(Weighted | 6) = (1/5) \\* (3/1)\n    P(Weighted | 6) = 3/5 = 0.6\n\n    Now let's calculate the probability that the die was fair given that we rolled a 6, P(Fair | 6).\n\n    P(Fair | 6) = \\[P(6 | Fair) \\* P(Fair)] / P(6)\n    P(Fair | 6) = \\[(1/6) \\* (4/5)] / (1/3)\n    P(Fair | 6) = (4/30) / (1/3)\n    P(Fair | 6) = (2/15) \\* (3/1)\n    P(Fair | 6) = 6/15 = 2/5 = 0.4\n\n    Since P(Weighted | 6) = 0.6 and P(Fair | 6) = 0.4, it is more likely that the die was weighted.\n\n4.  **Provide an explanation for each step.**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Summarize given conditions.** This step simply restates the information provided in the problem to make it easier to work with.\n    *   **Step 2: Identify the problem.** This step clarifies what we are trying to calculate: the probability that the die was weighted, given that a 6 was rolled.\n    *   **Step 3: Provide a clear, step-by-step solution.**\n        *   **Bayes' Theorem:** This is the core formula that allows us to update our belief (probability of the die being weighted) given new evidence (rolling a 6).\n        *   **P(Weighted | 6) = \\[P(6 | Weighted) \\* P(Weighted)] / P(6):** Applying Bayes' Theorem to our specific problem.\n        *   **P(6) = P(6 | Weighted) \\* P(Weighted) + P(6 | Fair) \\* P(Fair):** Using the Law of Total Probability to calculate the overall probability of rolling a 6, considering both weighted and fair dice.\n        *   **Calculating P(6):**  Plugging in the known probabilities to calculate the value of P(6).\n        *   **Plugging into Bayes' Theorem:** Substituting the calculated value of P(6) back into Bayes' Theorem to find P(Weighted | 6).\n        *   **Calculating P(Fair |6):** Substituting the calculated value of P(6) back into Bayes' Theorem to find P(Fair | 6).\n        *   **Comparing Probabilities:**  Comparing P(Weighted | 6) and P(Fair | 6) to determine which is more likely.\n    *   **Step 4: Provide an explanation for each step.** This step explains the reasoning behind each step in the solution.\n"
